            <p>Born to the beat of steel pan on the island of Trinidad and Tobago, 
                it was in my blood to be a dancer. As soon as my family immigrated to 
                the United States, I was enrolled in Classical Indian Dancing. From there,
                I began to consume dance classes like popcorn and added Ballet, Jazz, Tap,
                Burlesque, Salsa, Swing, Hip Hop, Breakdance and Musical to my repetoire. 
                Each style of dancing gave me something different. Each style built me. 
                This is the story of dancing as I am. This is the story of Dancing as Devina.

            <h2>Grit</h2>
            <p> <em>Bharatnatym</em> is where I started. It is considered Classical Temple Dancing in India. 
                The dances are steeped in the the Hindu culture and performed barefooted to music that is sung in Hindi.
                Since the dances are lyrical, I struggled more than the other six year olds in my class. Their families were 
                from India and they understood the words they were dancing to. They could match their expressions to the mood of the songs, whereas
                I was left confused and overwhelmed. 
                The callouses on the heels of my feet grew thicker and so did my grit. 
                Dancing <em>will</em> break you. It will rip you to shreds and expose the weaknesses in your heart, then it will breathe fire 
                into your lungs and raise you anew. I was broken hard.
            </p>
            <p>Each Sunday was a living hell for me as a child. I used to dread going to dance class because it made me hurt- physically and emotionally.
                I was different than my peers. I was a brown girl with brown eyes that danced to music that made me feel more <italic>brown</italic>.
                At elementary school, I was surrounded by tall boys and girls with porcelain skin. They played soccer and baseball and ate meat and potatoes.
                My family ate dhal and rice and drank tea and lassi, not soda or juice.
                I was painfully brown in school and yet, I was not Indian <italic>enough</italic> in dance class. My lack of language while dancing made me work 
                10x harder than anyone else did. I asked for a copy of the music to take home on cd. My mom and I translated it by hand. My father took me to dance class 
                each week and reminded me of how proud he was of me. I treasured his pride. It made me work harder. My mom began to video-record the dances in class so that
                I could dance to the tapes after school at home.
                It had been eight years. I was now starting high school.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Your father is sick". 
                "Your father is dying".
                These words shook my world. I thought that I, too, must be dying. 
                I asked to graduate dance. 
                At sixteen. 
                Only 1/10 dancers have an Arangetram (a two hour long solo performance that certifies you as a Professional Indian Dancer). 
                I was told that I was not at the correct level. 
                I said I would work as hard as it took to get me there. I was determined for my dad to see me graduate. I would be the pride and joy of his life. 
                I was unstoppable. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Every day for one year, I would leave highschool and go to a private dance lesson with my teacher. My mom  would record the dances and we would go home. 
                After class was over at 7pm, I would go home and dance to the tapes for two hours. 
                It paid off. I had my Arangetram at sixteen years old in front of 200 guests. I choreographed an entire dance and was adorned in mehendi (henna) and gold jewelry.
                My family flew up from Trinidad and Canada and friends of my mom and dad drove in from all over the US. 
                The ankle bells were so tight that my thin and twisted feet were bleeding out on the stage, but I smiled the whole way through.
                You were only allowed three mistakes throughout the entire dance, or you didn't get your certificate. 
                I got mine in front of my father.
                And I have never felt more alive.

            <h2>Friendship</h2>
            <p>While I was pursuing my professional certification as a Classical Indian Dancer, I was enrolled in two other forms of dance through my high school.
                My favorite of the two was <em>Tap</em>. I had tap class right after lunch period and right before biology. This was the highlight of my day. Only a few girls 
                were selected to paticipate in the dance classes as you had to test out of P.E. first. Luckily, I made the cut. My class was a modest size of twelve girls. We were not 
                part of the same friend groups in high school and I was pretty intimidated by them. A lot of them were <italic>popular</italic> and I was too shy to approach them. 
                This changed after week two of Tap. 
                "Everyone find a partner"
                My stomach tied in a knot. I felt nauseous and my hands were shaking. 
                I felt a tap on my shoulder. 
                A tall girl with shiny auburn hair asked to be my partner. 
                This was my first experience of family in dance. It was not long after that a third girl joined our trio. She was tiny and thin. Her name was Brittany.
                She was better than us as dancing. Her shuffles were clean and her hops had one beat, not two. 
                We practiced together in a glass dance room with the sun beating straight down on the honey colored tap floor. The ballet bar to the left - the one right in front of 
                the ceiling high glass mirrors - became the backbone of our unconventional friendship.
                "Whoo. I feel a little dizzy today. I'm going to ask if I can run to the restroom". This became a habit for Brittany. 
                Her tiny frame was wittling away to nothing beneath the dark grey hoodies she would wear. 
                They couldn't tell in Math or in English, but in dance class we could. 
                "Mary, I think Brittany is sick". 
                Mary and I struggled with the secret of our friend for over a month before we told a counselor. This was my first encounter with an eating disorder.
                It would not be my last. This was also the first time I learned that to be a good friend, sometimes you have to lose the friend you love because you are 
                protecting them from themself. 
                Mary and I lost Brittany. Her parents were called and they took her away for a while, but she came back bigger. 
                She came back stronger. 
                She left us, but found herself and I was taught a very sad and hard lesson about what it means to love a friend.

            <h2>Attitude and Sass </h2>
            <p>
                Something about wearing red lipstick and high heels at fifteen changes you. There's no deep emotional history connected to my love
                of Broadway&#8209;Style dancing. My love for theatrical dance stems from the thrill of the fun. Musical dancing teaches you one thing- attitude- and it 
                teaches it well. I learned to swing my hips and pout my lips. I learned the difference between a sultry eye and a flirtatious wink. I learned how to 
                ask for what I wanted with a look and a kiss. I learned the power of being female and it did away with my shyness for good.

            <h2>Teamwork</h2>
            <p>
                What did I learn from my instructor pushing my seventeen year old body into the splits? 
                What did I learn from being yelled at till I cried? 
                I learned the fine art of teamwork. If there is anything I took away from ballet other than bruises 
                and tears, it is the power of a good team. If one of us messed up, we would all get punished.
                If one of us performed a leap perfectly, we would all celebrate. We lived and cried as a whole.
                Our movements and our souls became unified. The parking lot outside of the studio saw more hugs than an airport.
                Ballet taught me what nothing else could- that your actions are larger than yourself. Ballet taught me the importance
                of community.
